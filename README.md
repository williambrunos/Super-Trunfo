# About the project
This is a simple web trump game developed on an event of Alura. The game consists on having a random card on your hand, you have to choose wich attribute 
do you want to use against the machinne. If your attribute is higher than the attribute chosen by the machinne, you win one point, if it's a draw, no one
wins a point, and if the machinne wins, it gains a point. The game continues until there's no card available to the players. The game it's not completed yet,
but once it is, i will disponibilize on a github pages for testing!

Play the trumph game with the Saint Seiya characters!
